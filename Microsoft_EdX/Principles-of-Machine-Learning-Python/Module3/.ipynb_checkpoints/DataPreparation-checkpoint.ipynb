    "# Data Preparation for Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data preparation** is a vital step in the machine learning pipeline. Just as visualization is necessary to understand the relationships in data, proper preparation or **data munging** is required to ensure machine learning models work optimally. \n",
    "\n",
    "The process of data preparation is highly interactive and iterative. A typical process includes at least the following steps:\n",
    "1. **Visualization** of the dataset to understand the relationships and identify possible problems with the data.\n",
    "2. **Data cleaning and transformation** to address the problems identified. It many cases, step 1 is then repeated to verify that the cleaning and transformation had the desired effect. \n",
    "3. **Construction and evaluation of a machine learning models**. Visualization of the results will often lead to understanding of further data preparation that is required; going back to step 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you will learn the following: \n",
    "- Recode character strings to eliminate characters that will not be processed correctly.\n",
    "- Find and treat missing values. \n",
    "- Set correct data type of each column. \n",
    "- Transform categorical features to create categories with more cases and coding likely to be useful in predicting the label. \n",
    "- Apply transformations to numeric features and the label to improve the distribution properties. \n",
    "- Locate and treat duplicate cases. \n"

    "\n",
    "In most cases, machine learning is not done with the raw features. Features are transformed, or combined to form new features in forms which are more predictive. This process is known as **feature engineering**. In many cases, good feature engineering is more important than the details of the machine learning model used. It is often the case that good features can make even poor machine learning models work well, whereas, given poor features even the best machine learning model will produce poor results. As the famous saying goes, \"garbage in, garbage out\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Some common approaches to feature engineering include:\n",
    "- **Aggregating categories** of categorical variables to reduce the number. Categorical features or labels with too many unique categories will limit the predictive power of a machine learning model. Aggregating categories can improve this situation, sometime greatly. However, one must be careful. It only makes sense to aggregate categories that are similar in the domain of the problem. Thus, domain expertise must be applied. \n",
    "- **Transforming numeric variables** to improve their distribution properties to make them more covariate with other variables. This process can be applied not only features, but to labels for regression problems. Some common transformations include, **logarithmic** and **power** included squares and square roots. \n",
    "- **Compute new features** from two or more existing features. These new features are often referred to as **interaction terms**. An interaction occurs when the behavior of say, the produce of the values of two features, is significantly more predictive than the two features by themselves. Consider the probability of purchase for a luxury mens' shoe. This probability depends on the interaction of the user being a man and the buyer being wealthy. As another example, consider the number of expected riders on a bus route. This value will depend on the interaction between the time of day and if it is a holiday. "
