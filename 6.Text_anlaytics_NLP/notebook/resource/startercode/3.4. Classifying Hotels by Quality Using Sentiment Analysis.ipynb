So now we have (1) our data from hotel reviews and (2) our sentiment vectorizer (positive and negative words). We're going to classify these by quality. The basic code is below; this just called our *text_analytics* package. That package splits the data into training and testing data, learns a classifier, and then evaluates the classifier.
